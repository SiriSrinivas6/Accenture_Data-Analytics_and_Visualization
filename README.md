Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage - March 2024

## Task 1 : Project Understanding
### Key roles and responsibilities of a Data Analyst

A data analyst sits between the business and the data.

What do we mean by that?

The Business refers to the client and your internal team members who won’t be involved in detailed data analysis.
They rely on your analysis to make strategic business decisions.
Importantly, not everyone will have a strong understanding of data. Your job is to communicate your data findings simply and clearly for everyone to understand.
 
The Data refers to the relevant data sources that you will clean, process, and use to generate interesting insights for the business.

### Read the brief from Social Buzz
Your first task is to read the brief from Social Buzz and complete a short knowledge check before the call. 

One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz.

She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project.

Mae has scheduled a project kick off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning.

Ahead of the call, Mae has shared the project brief so you can get up to speed on what Social Buzz need help with.

Read the brief to:

Understand the client and business problem at hand.
Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
Identify which tasks you should focus on as a Data Analyst.

Complete the knowledge check to move onto the next step. You can attempt each question in the knowledge check as many times as you like!
